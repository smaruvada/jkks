									<h3>Technological limitations</h3>
									<p>The myth that humans only utilize a small part of their brains gained popularity with early scientific explorations of brain function and scientists lacked the technology and abilities to capture how the brain truly worked. In 1907, William James, a pioneer in American psychology, suggested in his book “The Energies of Men” that we are using only a fraction of our mental and physical capabilities, which likely fueled this misconception.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-question"></span>
									<h3>Pop culture</h3>
									<p>Hollywood films, such as Lucy (2014) and Limitless (2011), perpetuated the myth that utilizing the "unused" 90% of the brain could result in superhuman abilities, thus embedding the concept into popular culture.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-question"></span>
									<h3>Incorrect comparisons</h3>
									<p>The myth that only 10% of the brain is used doesn’t have an exact origin. A reason this myth may have come to existence is because the lung, appendix, or kidney isn’t fully used to its full capacity. This is what most likely results in the myth that only 10% of the brain is used but that is false.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-question"></span>
									<h3>Timing</h3>
									<p>According to MRI and PET scans not every cell in the brain is used at the same time, but that does not mean only 10% of the brain is used. Every part of the brain is used, but not always at the same time which is also a huge misconception that causes people to believe that only 10% of the brain is used.</p>

							<h2>How we use our brains</h2>
							<!--<p>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, russian blue ragdoll. Birman abyssinian and bobcat scottish fold havana brown, bobcat or himalayan.</p>-->
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-microscope"></span>
									<h3>Fact</h3>
									<p>If we only used that small portion of a brain, the majority of brain injuries would have little to no effect on us since they would be affecting parts of the brain that were believed to not even be used in the first place.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-microscope"></span>
									<h3>Fact</h3>
									<p>Modern neuroscience research proves that significantly more of 10% of the brain is active, nearly every part of the brain is active. Imaging techniques like fMRI and PET scans reveal that even the simplest tasks we perform such as reading, writing, or speaking all use multiple regions of the brain simultaneously.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-microscope"></span>
									<h3>Fact</h3>
									<p>Natural selection in itself also disproves this idea as it discourages the development of useless anatomical structures like a head full of useless tissue. Early humans who devoted resources to growing and maintaining these large amounts of brain tissues that weren’t even being used would have been outcompeted by those who spent resources on other things more necessary for survival, like stronger muscles, more hair, etc. as quite literally anything would be more beneficial than having a skull full of useless tissue.</p>

				<!-- So What -->
					<section id="what" class="wrapper style3 fade-up">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
							<p>Knowing how major organs in your body, like your brain, function allows people to make better and more educated decisions about their health, both mental and physical. Being educated about the brain and its functions encourages people to engage in daily activities such as exercise, reading, social connections, etc. to increase neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to adapt to change) that increases people’s overall cognitive health. Overall, rather than chasing myths about fake facts, individuals should focus on ways to increase the cognitive performance of their whole brain, not just 10%.</p>

									<h3>It Corrects Misconceptions About Intelligence</h3>
									<p>Myths like the "10% brain usage" claim lead people to believe they're not using their full potential. In reality, the human brain operates near full capacity for its size and energy use. Understanding this helps people appreciate that intelligence isn't about "unlocking" new parts of the brain but about how effectively we use and develop the ones we already have.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-check"></span>
									<h3>It Highlights the Complexity of Neural Networks</h3>
									<p>The brain's structure is astonishingly intricate, containing about 86 billion neurons that each form thousands of connections. These networks are constantly communicating, regulating everything from emotion to memory to movement. Recognizing this complexity builds appreciation for how finely tuned and efficient our neural systems are.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-check"></span>
									<h3>It Deepens Understanding of Brain Health and Recovery</h3>
									<p>Neuroscientists study how different regions of the brain respond to injury, disease, or stress. This research helps improve treatments for mental health conditions, brain injuries, and neurodegenerative diseases. Knowing that every brain region plays a vital role underscores the importance of protecting and maintaining brain health throughout life.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-check"></span>
									<h3>It Shows That the Brain Is Always Active — Even at Rest</h3>
									<p>Contrary to the idea of unused brain areas, recent studies on the default mode network reveal that the brain remains active even when we're not focusing on a specific task. During rest or daydreaming, the brain processes information, consolidates memories, and sparks creativity. This means downtime is not wasted — it's an essential part of cognitive growth.</p>
